<h2> The Psychology of Money <br>
Morgan Housel </h2>
<br>
<p>He emphasizes that your connection with money isn't rooted in science or math but in emotions like fear and greed, pride and envy, and the social comparisons that shape your psychological relationship with money.<br> Getting carried away by such emotions may make you less wealthy and keep you unsatisfied for life.</p>
